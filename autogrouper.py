## This script allows you to combine segment *.txt files, such as those from edgetrak_output_converter.py.  Given a set of *.txt files each with data from an individual segment, this script groups them into whatever two groups you wish to compare using the R script.

## Example 1: comparing two segments
## In this case, both groups consist of only one segment apiece.  Say you want to compare FD's [e] to their [o], and these data are stored in FD-e.txt and FD-o.txt, respectively.  Run the script, and at the first prompt, enter 'all' (without quotes) and press Enter/Return.  (Using 'all' here means that there is no limit set on how many tokens are used from each vowel.)  At the next prompt, enter the name of the file you want the script to output, e.g. 'FD-e-vs-o' (do not enter a file extension).  When prompted for the name of the first group, enter 'mid-front', and when asked for the name of the next group, enter 'mid-back'.  Since there are only two groups of interest for now, enter 'end' at the next prompt.  Now you will add component segment files into the groups.  Since the one vowel in the 'mid-front' group is [e], stored in the file FD-e.txt, you will enter 'FD-e' at the next prompt.  Enter 'end' at the following one to end addition of vowels into this group.  When prompted to add a vowel to the 'mid-back' group, enter 'FD-o', then end at the next prompt.  The output file will now be created.

## Example 2: comparing two groups of segments
## Suppose that you want to compare the two high vowels [u] and [i] as a group (average) to the two mid vowels [o] and [e], in order to determine whether there are any articulatory differences between the two classes.  Now suppose that you have 20 tokens of [u], [i], and [o], but only 15 tokens of [e].  In order to ensure that the data from [o] is not overrepresented in the mid vowel group ([o] and [e]), you must limit the number of tokens to 15.  In such a scenario, at the first prompt ('frames per segment'), you will enter '15'.  Then continue to create the two groups ('high' and 'mid') and add vowels to each group normally (add 'FD-u', and 'FD-i' to 'high', then add 'FD-e' and 'FD-o' to mid, assuming the same file name convention as Example 1).

## Example 3: creating a file with all vowel groups
## The files that this script creates are not limited to having only two groups.  You may wish to create a single file with all data from every segment group of interest, and then pick out subsets of it to compare using the R script.  This can be done in the same way as the examples above: simply continue adding more groups after the second one.  You are free to include a particular vowel's data in multiple groups.

## Note that the selection of "groups" is what determines the label applied in the first column to all the items from each segment in that group.

## Typical use will involve creating a set of full segment groups (using "all" at the first prompt, one group for each segment, and one segment per group) for segment-to-segment comparisons, then creating full segment groups of segments which are split into, e.g. oral and nasal subsets, and then finally creating the groups of subsets for segment group testing.
